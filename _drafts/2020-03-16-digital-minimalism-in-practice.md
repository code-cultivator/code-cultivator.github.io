Our society is slowly beginning to acknowledge the detremental effects of technology. Whether its our health, relationships, or mental health, most of us feel the pull of our attention in directions that are not best serving us. Between the stress of constant communication from work, the feelings of inadequecy garnered by social media, and that one time my wife launched my iPhone across the room to get my attention, my relationship with technology needed some counseling. I began to ask myself if all of this was really necessary - were social media, a smart phone, and ubiqitous internet access helping me become the person I want to be, or hindering it? 

I'm not claiming that abandoning these things is for everyone, but for my goals they are not only unneccesary, but a distraction. 
The transision has been slow. I left all social media in February of 2019, celebrated my independence on July 4, 2019 by upgrading to a flip phone, and most recently, cancelling my home internet connection in September of 2019. 

### Social Media


#### Privacy
It seems that while people are becoming increasingly aware of the privacy issues arround social media, they are becoming decreasingly able to resist its novelty. 
#### Mental Health

> The tycoons of social media have to stop pretending that they're friendly nerd gods building a better orld and admit they're cust tobacco farmers in T-shirts selling an addictive product to children. Because, let's face it, checking your "likes" is the new smoking. - Bill Maher, May 12, 2017

#### Time
The average American spends __ per day on social media. What if they used that time to learn to play the accordion?

### "Smart" Phones

#### Control
Modern cell phones are in truth, computers - even my flip phone runs android. An ineresting conundrum we face is a market that does not contain a phone running free software.

#### Finance
Before we were purchasing about an $800 phone every 3-4 years. Now we both use lightly used Kyocera DuraXVs we got on eBay for about $100 each. We no longer pay for insurace or data - bringing our phone expenses down from $100 per month to $40.

#### Freedom
