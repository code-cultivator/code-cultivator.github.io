Slowly, our society is beginning to acknowledge the detrimental effects of technology. Whether its our health, relationships, or mental health, most of us feel the pull of our attention in directions that are not best serving us. Between the stress of constant communication from work, the feelings of inadequacy garnered by social media, and that one time my wife launched my iPhone across the room to get my attention, my relationship with technology needed some counseling. I began to ask myself if all of this was really necessary - were social media, a smart phone, and ubiquitous internet access helping me become the person I want to be, or hindering it? 

I'm not claiming that abandoning these things is for everyone, but for my goals they are not only unnecessary, but a distraction. 

# My Experience

On July 4th, 2019, I declared independence from my smart phone, and purchased a Kyocera DuraXV flip phone. I'm sure that would not be a leap for everyone, but as an individual that loves technology, this was a big step for me. After reading a series of books, including Digital Minimalism and Deep Work by Cal Newport, I decided to take the plunge into a less distracted life. 

I could continue to try and philosophise here, but I'm a practical guy - so I'd like to provide some tips for those who are interested in ditching their smartphones. I hope you can learn from my challenges and how I overcame them.

# Challenges, Work-Arounds, and Compromises

## Internet
While it isn't much better than surfing the web on a potato, in a pinch, phones like my Kyocery DuraXV do have a browser if you find yourself in a pinch - it can even play YouTube videos. However, I suggest a more radical shift than doing what you used to with your smart phone, only now on a tiny screen and a T9 keybard. The solution I have come to prefer is knowing knowledgeable people and giving them a friendly call. There was once a time when people relied on the knowledge of their friends and family, and I think it contributes to a strong relationship. Learn to rely on contacts, and they will do the same. It sure beats talking about the weather (again).

That being said, we've adapted in many ways to also not have an internet connection at home for the 6 months prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. When the library closed and coffee shops stopped allowing dine-ins, we decided to reinstate our internet connection, but are looking forward to going back to our internet-free life when posssible. I intend to talk more offline living in the future.

## Messaging Applications
It seems like a new messaging app comes out ever day these days - Facebook messenger, Google Hangouts, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord - how can one live without them?
Blissfully. I have a phone number and and email, and honestly that's enough - maybe I'd like to find a way to have only one method of contact, but I haven't figured that one out just yet.

## Social Media
If you're reading this post and haven't removed social media from your smartphone yet, I suggest you start there. The tech giants have invested a lot of money in getting you hooked on social media, and getting away from it is a strength of the flip phone, not a weakness. My personal "digital minimalism" journey started first by abandoning social media, and adoping a flip phone came about six months later.

## Camera
We've grown accustomed to always having a camera in reach. I used to use mine very frequently, but since leaving social media, I have found this is something I rarely need. Now if I want to send a photo, I'm only sending it to one person and the need to take the perfect shot has dissolved. When I do want to take a great picture, I use a device designed specifically for this task - my DSLR. A common theme across many of my solutions is using devices designed for specific tasks. This not only yields better results, but also minimizes potential distraction.
If I want to take photos, I take my camera, otherwise - the experience itself is the focus - not a selfie depending on the removal of context.

## Music
Music is a challenge, as many of us use our phones not only to converse, but as portable media devices. My solution to this has involved unsubscribing from Spotify and managing my own DRM-free music library. The process has not only supplied me with the nostalgia of actually having music on my hard drive, but also the forgotten familiarity I once had for the artists who's albums I listen to regularly. My Kyocera DuraXV has an SD slot and a music player which is my solution for portable music.

## Audiobooks & Podcasts
This is one of the larger challenges for me - as a farmer, I spend a lot of time doing repettitive tasks, and audiobooks and podcasts can be a pleasant distraction from the monotany. I'm not sure if this distraction is a good thing, however. I think it would be more virtuous to have no need for such distractions, but I do feel that I get value from the insights I obtain while transplanting yet another box of literally thousands of onions. The constraints I place on listening to audio while I work shift with the season and my mood - sometimes I'm completely unplugged, other times I'm knocking out a complete audiobook every day.

I have yet to find a solution for listening to audiobooks that I'm happy with as the media player on my Kyocera DuraXV does not have a way of saving my location in audio files. Currently I still have a smartphone around and use it for these purposes, but I'm looking into getting an old-fashioned media player specifically for this purpose.
