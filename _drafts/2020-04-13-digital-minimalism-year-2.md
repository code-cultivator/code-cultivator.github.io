All of us who have attempted to improve ourselves have faced the challenge of making lasting change. Often the path is paved with failures, but eventually, hard work tends to pay off. 

Last spring, I made some radical changes to my life after reading [Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/) by [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com) and [Irresistable](http://adamalterauthor.com/irresistible/) by [Adam Atler](http://adamalterauthor.com). In the span of 6 months, I abandoned all social media, swapped my iPhone for a flip phone (a [Kyocera DuraXV][1]), and went without a home internet connection for 6 months (until COVID-19 forced the closure of our free internet locations: coffee shops and the library).

Life is a balancing act, and there always remain improvements to be made. I've been re-reading Digital Minimalism and contemplating my habits once more.

To sum up actionable part of the book, Cal Newport suggests that instead of adopting all technology without comptemplation, it would be more skillful to ask:
* Does this serve something I deeply value?
* Is this the best way to serve this value?

And then: 
* Have contraints on how and when you use the given technology.

Some examples from my life that I'm currently contemplating changes around include:

# Deep Values
#### Communitation
* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)
	* Is this the best way to serve this value?
		* No
			* Digital messages are a poor substitute for in-person conversation or a phone call
			* Discord is not open-source
	* Constraints
		* I will no longer be using Discord
* [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)
	* Is this the best way to serve this value?
		* Sometimes
	* Constraints
		*
* Text Messaging
	* Is this the best way to serve this value?
		* Sometimes, but not usually
			* Text messages are great for logistical commucations, especially for setting up plans to have an in-person or phone conversation.
	* Constraints
		* I have been, and will continue to make efforts to avoid attempting to hold conversations in this format and opt instead for phone calls or in-person conversations.
* Email
	* Is this the best way to serve this value?
		* Sometimes, but not usually
			* I really only use email for work or for sending attachements.
	* Constraints
		* I should have control of my data
			* I've made great strides on this front in the last year by moving my email to [PrivateEmail](https://privateemail.com/) (owned by [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)) to avoid the spyware known as Gmail, but would like to learn to host my own email this year. 
		* I should use open-source software
			* I've also learned to use the open-source email client [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/)
		* I should recieve as little email as possible
			* I've unsubscribed from all email newsletters and opted to use RSS for content I want to keep up with. I can go weeks without getting email - it's magnificent. 
			* While my [Kyocera DuraXV][1] is capable of sending and recieving emails, I've chosen not to use this feature.

#### Learning
* Audiobooks
	* Is this the best way to serve this value?
		* Sometimes
	* Constraints
		* I should have control of my data
			* Over the last year I've moved away from using [Audible](https://www.audible.com/) for my audiobooks (through the help of [OpenAudible](https://openaudible.org/)) in favor of DRM-free options, such as [audiobookstore](https://audiobookstore.com/). 			
			* I should use open-source software
				* While I'm now able to play my DRM-free audiobooks on my [Kyocera DuraXV][1], it is not capable of saving the location a file was last played - a must have feature for listening to long audio files like audiobooks. So I'm currently looking at old [SanDisk Sansa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SanDisk_Sansa) media players that are capable of running [RockBox](https://www.rockbox.org/), an open-source replacement for the original proprietary firmware. I've yet to pull the trigger on this as I am waiting for a good deal on eBay.
		* I should leave time for solitude
			* TBD
* Podcasts
	* Is this the best way to serve this value?
		* Sometimes
	* Constraints
		* I should have control of my data
			* My current solution utilizes [newsboat][2] and [podboat][3] to download audio files from RSS feeds of my chosen podcasts, which I copy over to my [Kyocera DuraXV][1].
		* I should use open-source software
			* [newsboat][2] and [podboat][3] are open-source
		* I should leave time for solitude
			* TBD
	* Previously, I used Apple Podcasts on my iPhone. Not only is this solution not open-source, but I feel it is *too* convienient. This convienence enabled me to check-out more than I currently think is ideal. My new solution uses [newsboat][2] and [podboat][3] to download audio files from RSS feeds of my chosen podcasts, which I copy over to my [Kyocera DuraXV][1].
* Blogs
	* Is this the best way to serve this value?
		* Sometimes
	* Constraints
		* I should use open-source software
			* [newsboat][2] is open source at its use frees me from running proprietary javascript.
		* I should remain focused
			* RSS is a great and underutilized technology in my opinions. It removes all of the distactions.
		* I should maintain my privacy
			* Making a single request for a RSS feed from behind a good [VPN](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) and a [DNS Server](https://dns.watch/) you trust is close to as good as possible. Tor may be better but when combined with my other values, I find this the best option for me.
* YouTube
	* Is this the best way to serve this value?
		* Sometimes
	* Constraints
		* I should use open-source software
			* I use [newsboat][2] to "subscribe" to my favorite YouTube channels
		* I should remain focused
		* I should maintain my privacy
* Entertainment
	* Music
