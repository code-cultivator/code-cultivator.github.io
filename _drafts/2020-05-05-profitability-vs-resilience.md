It's been almost three years since I shifted my primary method of generating an income from technical work to agricultural. While my reasons were multifaceted, a large motivator was my growing realization of how fragile our society is - its utter dependence on a global market place, ceaseless growth, fossil fuels, and, to be frank, plain-old greed. Without any of these, the system would collapse - many became only aware of this in the wake of the current issue with COVID-19. 

Not long ago, I come to the humbling realization that if the power went out, my skills as a software engineer and system administrator would be worthless, and the blue-collar workers that I had been subtly taught to look down upon would replace the prestige of the college-educated worker.

I vaguely remember discussing the trade-offs of security and performance in my computer science courses, but I never realized that this duality is near universal. In agriculture, farmers have to choose to setup their farms on the spectrum of profitability vs. resilience.

For example, we could choose to use water pumps that rely on electricity (which we do) or we could hand-pump the water and be independent. This can similarly be compared to hosting in-house or using an external service to manage running the platform. Economics tend to push businesses towards specialization and out-sourcing whatever can be to specialists, but this clearly poses a problem - especially when it comes to something, necessary, say food.

When we outsource our food production beyond our own gardens, neighboring farms, counties, states, countries, and continents - we loose more than our metaphysical connection with the farmers and the land - we loose our security. 

If and when we see food shortages, having a 6+ figure salary will not save us. The farmer will feed his own - because money will now be worthless. What will have value is a handful of eggs and a sack of potatoes.
