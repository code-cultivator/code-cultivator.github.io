By now, most of us have heard of the idea of being "off-grid" - out in the sticks somewhere, with no ties to the electrical grid, running water, internet, or access to feeds to scroll. Is this idea proposterous? Maybe, maybe not, but as with many things, maybe the sweet spot is somewhere in the between. For me, at this point in my life, I'm not interested in giving up all the convieniences of electriciy or running water, but I try to think hard about the electronics I want in my home. In my kitchen you'll find a polethera of electronics: a blender, a food processor, a vaccum sealer, dehydrator, refrigerator, kettle, the list in this room goes on - but you won't find a microwave or a keureg. Stroll into the living room and you'll find an eBike charging and a fan cooling a work area over a sewing machine - but you won't find a tv. The bedroom features a fan or a heater, depending on the time of year, but that's it - nope, no alexa. When guests ask for the wifi password, they're surprised (some more than others) to discover we don't have internet at home.

What the hell is going on here?
