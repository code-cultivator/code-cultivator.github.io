I hope you can forgive my absence. It's been a while since we last spoke, and while we once talked frequently, we never grew beyond aquaintances - our conversations the equivalent of talking to a stranger about the weather - an impersonal exchange of nicities, my ego showing you only what I wanted you to see. I'm sure you grew bored of my selfies, zingy pop-culture references, and food porn - but you were so polite - you never called me out.

I know your politeness is a bit obligatory - after all, you were selling our "conversations", the photos I shared, my search queries, my shopping habits, and more to corporations that now run the world, but I won't hold that against you. We both knew the game we were playing - we were both looking out for no one but ourselves.

That being said, I hope we can start off on a new footing. Perhaps I'm naiive, but I'd like to think you're not all bad; I've seen the glimmers of greatness in you and I hope that perhaps, you might feel the same way about me.

I know it'll take work, but I think we should give this thing another shot. 

What do you say?
