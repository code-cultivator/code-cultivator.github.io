Renown advice given by any college career advisor, seeming to imply we should all wear fitted dress shirts, slacks, and over-priced wrist watches. Many seem to heed this advice with baby-esque shaved faces and the perennially trimmed haircut.

As for me, I will continue to sport the look of the unkempt–the long hair, scraggly beard, the shirt and pants stained by soil and sweat with holes patched and yet-to-be patched. For I do not want a “job,” but rather a life–and, if achievable, one of virtue. For where is the virtue in keeping up with the Joneses? And for that matter, who are these Joneses? Am I to believe there are no domains under which I can keep up with them? Perhaps I cannot keep up with the speed at which they fill the garbage cans they take to the curb each week, but this bothers me not. I prefer the pace of the slow–the pace at which water grinds stone to sand, the pace at which the juniper grows, a pace that can stand the test of time. 

So I’ll grant that there are matters in which my appearance hinders my so-called “career,” keeping in mind the word “career” derives its origin from the horse race. For a horse I am not–but a man, and one in no hurry. A race suggests a finish line, yet when I look to the horizon, I see the beauty of the earth meeting the sky–but a finish line, I see not. If I could see far enough, I’d see the back of my unkempt mane and the world that stands in between, and the endless mirror beyond. 

If only we could see so far. 

Perhaps seeing ourselves from such a distance, we could clearly witness the blur between us and our surroundings. Maybe then we’d finally see there is no “I” to “progress”–but rather an eternal “we”–and learn to dress for our collective future instead.
